                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Being the <strong>HUGE</strong> gamer that Jajuan is, his progression into 
                    software development has been fairly natural. Ever since the day he built his first
                    computer, which exposed him to the wonders of computer hardware, he was thoroughly hooked 
                    by the world of technology. Now with the skills he has gained in software development, he's able
                    to start his own fun projects. This, at first, hobby is now something he would love to do professionally. 
                    So, here he is!</p>

                    <div class="hobby-one">
                        <p>If Jajuan had to name his favorite passtime it would definitely have to be gameing.
                            His father like him loved video games since he was a child and, naturally, that brushed off on him.
                            Growing up he played he wide variety of games, and that habbit has stuck to this day. Jajuan's favorite games
                            are Battlefield, FFXIII, Kingdom Hearts, and more!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="hobby-two">
                        <p>When he isn't gaming Jajuan has a profound love for making music. He's sort of a jack of all trades, dabbling
                            in Hip-Hop, Lo-fi, and Indie music. However, his most favorite style to make music in is Orchestral. Jajuan is a fan of composers like
                            Masashi Hamauzu, Joe Hisiashi, John Williams, and Danny Elfmann, all of whom primarily compose music for film or video games! His favorite soundtrack
                            is from the game FFXII, a game part of the Final Fantasy that came out in the late 2000's, in which composer Masashi Hamauzu made most of the music.
